In the first task, we implemented the low-pass filter to remove the noise from the recorded audio signal. In this project, a low-pass filter (LPF) with a cutoff frequency of 8 kHz is implemented to eliminate white Gaussian noise. A notch filter is also
designed to remove specific undesired frequencies, such as hums or electrical interference. Initially, we recorded the audio signal using MATLAB and stored it. Then we
selected a segment of the signal to apply low low-pass filter to it. Here is the block-diagram, magnitude, and phase response of the filtered audio signal;
